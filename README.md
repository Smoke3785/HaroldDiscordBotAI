# HaroldDiscordBotAI

HaroldBot is a Discord bot in which users are able to add to their Discord server. I created the bot to do simple tasks such as mathematical addition and to say ‘hello’ to the user. In addition, HaroldBot is integrated with OpenAI and is able to answer a variety of questions the user may have.

Note, a .env file is created for tokens and due to privacy reasons my .env file is hidden.

DISCORD_TOKEN = 'put your discord token here'
OPEN_AI_KEY = 'put your open ai key here'

are some variables that would need to be put into the .env file for the discord bot to work.
